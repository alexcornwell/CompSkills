**about me**: I am a first year PhD student here at UAF in 
Kristin O'Brien's lab. I will be working on a project involving the 
physiological response of Antarctic notothenioid fishes to hypoxia 
stress. Outside of the lab and classes, I really like cycling and making 
coffee & espresso. I'm beginning to get into climbing, and I hope to 
explore cross-country skiing in the near future!
